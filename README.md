# GymFit Fitness Gym â€“ Responsive Design Project

[Live Demo on GitHub Pages](https://doreenmongina.github.io/IYFproject1/)

## Overview

This project is a creative reimagining of a large-screen (LG) mockup, transformed into a modern, accessible, and fully responsive fitness gym website. The design maintains the original layout structure for desktops, but introduces a unique color palette, branding, and custom breakpoints for tablets and mobile devices.
